## Artificial Intelligence
Go through the following videos in given order to familiarize yourself with Artificial Intelligence:

### What is Machine Learning?

Ever wondered how Instagram shows you posts of your Interest? It uses machine learning algorithms to learn you interests by your earlier interaction with the app. That's what machine learning is - It gives computers the ability to learn from data and make decisions on it's own. Let's learn about machine learning in the following video  from Ale Flores(product manager at Alexa) and Chelsea(Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence). Hope you'll enjoy it.

### Training Data and Bias

Now that we saw in machine learning, computers are provided with data to help it learn and make better decisions. In the following video Chelsea(Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence) explains how this data is provided to the computers and what can be considered a good training data for machines to learn. Hope you'll enjoy it.

### How Neural Network Works?

Now that we learned about traning data and Bias, how are machine leraning algorithms actually work? How computers uses training data to learn? Lets learn this in the following video from Deon(co-creator of Forethought AI) where he explains about nerral networks. Hope you'll enjoy it.

### How Computer Vision Works?

In the following video, Alejandro(Robotics Engineer) who creates robots to identify and remove weeds on it's own and  Kate(Tesla autopiolet Engineer) works with self driving cars. Both of them creates technologies which require computers to see. Let's hear from them about how computers sees and take decisions based on it. Hope you'll enjoy it.

### Ethics and Artificial Intelligence

We learned that in order to train machine, we have to provide it with some training data and then it makes decision on it's own. But what if we couldn't provide all necessary data and computers make some harmfull decision based on that. Ethical questions are always raised on the working on AI. Lets hear about it and future of AI from experts in the following two videos.
